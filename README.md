# SongLib Backend

This repository contains the backend for the **SongLib** application, a platform that allows users to manage, store, and access their song collections. The backend is deployed at [songlive.vercel.app](https://songlive.vercel.app), providing API endpoints to power the SongLib frontend and handle various operations related to songs.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a typical Node.js backend structure, with models, routes, and API logic neatly organized into their respective directories.

```
SongLibBe/
├── api/                 # API-related logic and handlers
├── models/              # Database models for songs, users, etc.
├── routes/              # Route definitions for API endpoints
├── index.js             # Main entry point for the server
├── package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
├── .env.example         # Example environment variables file
└── vercel.json          # Vercel deployment configuration
```

### Key Files and Directories

- **`api/`**: Contains the core logic for interacting with songs and handling API requests.
- **`models/`**: Defines the database schema for the entities used in SongLib (e.g., songs, users).
- **`routes/`**: Defines the endpoints for interacting with the API, including song CRUD operations.
- **`index.js`**: The main file that initializes the server and connects the routes and database.
- **`vercel.json`**: Contains the configuration for deploying the backend to Vercel.

## Getting Started

Follow this guide to set up and run SongLib Backend:

### Set up the Environment Variables

The backend requires specific environment variables to run. These variables should be stored in a `.env` file at the root of your project. An example `.env.example` file is provided in this repository.

Here are the required environment variables:

- **`DATABASE_URL`**: Connection string for your database contact the developer to get the key for the database URL

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Setting Up SongLibBe:

To get started with this project, you'll need Node.js installed. You can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone SongLib repository from GitHub using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:SiroDaves/SonglibBe.git
 
2. **Install Packages:** Navigate to the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running SongLib:
Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, you can run the backend locally using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server in development mode, and it should be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.
